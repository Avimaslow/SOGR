# State of Good Repair (SOGR) Dashboard

## Overview
The State of Good Repair (SOGR) Dashboard provides a centralized view of asset readiness across the organization.  
It is designed to help stakeholders monitor asset health, replacement cycles, and projected upgrade timelines with interactive visuals.  

This project consolidates data from multiple sources, aligns asset information with SOGR planning years, and presents clear drill-downs by location, device type, and model.
